Welcome! Here, I hope to outline tips and trick of how to use a few wonderful git development tools, and how to use some of the more advanced features of those tools. 

I'll try to cover how to get some basic environment prerequisites installed including homebrew and a more recent version of git, and how to integrate those into a more advanced terminal environment. Hopefully as we go alog, you can learn as I have what a powerful tool git can be in your development toolbox!

Stay tuned for our first installment, "Getting your environment set up"!
