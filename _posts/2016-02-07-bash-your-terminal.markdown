## Why Bash?

I use _bash_. It's available on almost all systems, and is the default terminal for most. For the purposes of _ease of use_ and _consistency_, I'll be using _bash_ throughout most of the tutorials posted here. There are other alternatives of course like `zsh` and `fish` but I won't be spending any time to integrate these tutorials into those other shells. If you're using something other than _bash_, chances are you can handle adapting any scripts that have issues running in your terminal.

## What? Bash?

Bash is a _Unix shell_, and a strongly integrated part of your development environment. Taking care to curate your `.bashrc` file and other configuration files is important, and if done wrong can cause your evironment to become unusable.
